            Study Spaces at U-M is a tool designed to help you find and reserve designated study spaces, computer stations, a space for you to take a remote class, or just a dedicated quiet touchdown spot between classes.<br><br>
            It's understandable that many might be anxious that there aren't many spaces on the site, after going through the last academic year where the primary method of accessing study space was to reserve. <br><br>
            As we proceed into the next academic year, several spaces have been designated as open and reservations are not needed. Some units took spaces offline that were offered, as they currently have in-person classes this semester, or an increase in need for event space.

                    <strong>Angell Hall Courtyard Computing Center (The Fishbowl)</strong>
                    The Angell Hall Courtyard Computer Center, more popularly known as the Fishbowl, is not just a beautiful architectural creation, but also an area with endless rows of Macs and PCs.

                    <strong>Michigan Union</strong>
                    The lower level of the Michigan Union is a more active area and a great option for group work. The business of this building can make it hard to find spots for focused study sessions.

                    <strong>Law Quad (The Courtyard)</strong>
                    The Law Quadrangle is known for its beauty. The courtyard is surrounded by stone buildings that some may say almost reflect the magical nature of Hogwarts. For those who enjoy studying in nature, this is the perfect spot for you. The greenery and open areas provide an amazing environment for you to escape the busy campus life.
